## Calculate Target Calories

1. Find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) 
2. Multiply BMR by an activity ratio to determine Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
3. Adjust your TDEE by adding or subtracting calories to reach your goal

BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation):
- Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
- Women: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161

Activity Ratio
- Sedentary: 1.2 (little to no exercise)
- Lightly Active: 1.375 (light exercise 1-3 days/week)
- Moderately Active: 1.55 (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week)
- Very Active: 1.725 (hard exercise 6-7 days/week)
- Super Active: 1.9 (very hard exercise or physical job)

Calories Goal
- Weight Loss: subtract 500~1,000 calories
- Weight Mantain: 0
- Weight Gain: add ?

Formula:
- TDEE = BMR * Activity Ratio
- Target Calories = TDEE +/- Calories Goal
